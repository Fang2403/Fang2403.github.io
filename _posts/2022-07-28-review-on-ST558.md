## Using R for Data Science
In my opinion, R is wonderful for data science. With vibrant community support, it is a pwerful tool to analyze data and build models. There are tons of shared packages to deal with various data problems effeciently. However, it is said to be slow with big data, I haven't had experience using R with big data and stream data though. As in industry, lots of data science problems are with big or stream data now, I definetely want to try using R with them and search for speeding up methods. I have good experience with R so far, and want to know how it is working with more complex data. So I will continue to use R going forward at least for a while.    
## In practice
I used to do inference work with R and analysis and modles building with Python. From now on, I will also use R to conduct the whole project. More important is that now I know how to create dashboards with R and deploy, share them. In the future, I will try to make more dashboard with R and also try to work with docker. 
## Futrure Plan
I am planing to focus on building proper models in the future. I am felling so excited when gaining precise predictions or finding the hidden patterns or relationship in the data. It is so amazing to explore the hidden insights behind the complex data. So I will keep learning more methods and practicing them in different fields.
