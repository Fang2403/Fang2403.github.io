# Being a Data Scientist

Being a data scientist should be able to derive valuable insights from the data to provide accurate predictions and power critical business decisions. A data scientist does the statistical analysis required to determine which algorithm to use, then they model the predictive algorithm and prototype it for testing.  

A good data scientist should have solid computer science, statistics, and specific domain knowledge.

# Major Duties and knowledge areas

## Duties

Data scientists are responsible for translating business problems into more of a technical model, cleaning large amounts of data, exploring data sets to identify valuable insights, building predictive models, and running data science projects from end to end.

The role typically demands: 

* Abilities to correctly understand company's needs and potential solutions
* Use appropriate databases and project designs to analyze
* Develop statistical models for analysis
* Develop predictive models to optimize decisions
* Communicate results and statistical concepts to key business leaders

## knowledge areas

The role needs strong knowledge of:

* Statistics
* Programing language, like Python, SAS, R, Scala, adn SQL
* knowledge in specific domain

# differences between data scientists and statisticians

1. The type of problems focused:
Data scientists focus on solving specific problems, while the statisticians focus more on the academic statistics. 

2. The academic background
Compared to a statistician, data scientists know a lot more about programming. Data scientists should have decent computer science, statistics, and specific domain knowledge.

3. Data scale:
Data scientists are well-equipped to ingest, clean and transform large-scale real-world data. Statisticians work on more traditional and smaller scale data. 

4. Modeling process:
Data scientists compare the predictive accuracy of different algorithms to select the model with the best accuracy. On the other hand, statisticians improve a single simple model by addressing assumptions in the model that are violated to best fit the data.

# similarities  between data scientists and statisticians

Data scientists and statisticians all aim to extract insights through description, prediction and causal inference from data. 
They both need a decent statistics background to fully understand the science behind their work, programming languages and models to analyze data and provide predictions.

# About myself

I did my first graduate in mathematics and am doing my second graduate in statistics, so this part is my strong suit. However, programming and communication through English are not. For this reason, I think I am more suitable to be a statistician. Meanwhile I enjoy learning programming and really hope to tackle large-scale real-word data to enhance decisions and provide predictions. So I am more hoping to change my career into the data science field.
